# Connecting the Laser to the Level

### The laser should disappear when colliding with a wall/object

### If it collides with an enemy it should trigger a function

### Finally, it should disappear after a certain amount of time

### That way, we cannot have an infinite laser

### We want to limit the number of objects in the game (for performance)

### We will add a timer to remove the laser (even if it doesn't hit anything)
