# SetGet

### Currently, we are updating the player stats and then update the UI

### But this is getting complex fast

### What would be much better is to have some code that updates the UI automatically once any player stat changes (from Globals)

## SetGet

### Allows us to run code whenever the value of a variable is changed or accessed

### For example, whenever the health of the player changes, we want to update the UI from Globals
