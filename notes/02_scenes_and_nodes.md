# 02 - Scenes and Nodes

## Creating Scenes and Nodes

- Level Scene
  - Pictures
  - Player
- Player Scene
  - Picture

### Within the 2D scene, everything in the blue window rectangle is visible to the player

### We will create a Node2D, then rename it to `Level`

#### Now we will save this to using `Scene->Save Scene` and create a new file at `res://scenes/levels`

### Then we create a `Sprite2D` child node within `Level`

### All of the transformations to a parent node are applied to the child nodes

### Nodes are drawn from top-to-bottom in the tree in which they are located

#### root node is drawn first and then leaf nodes are drawn last
