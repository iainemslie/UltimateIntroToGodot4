# Creating Multiple Levels

### You just have to create more level scenes

### Unfortunately, it isn't that easy

### Our level contains quite a bit of code. If we created other level scenes this logic would not be available. We could copy it but that would be very inefficient.

# Inheritance

### We want to create a parent level scene that contains all the logic

### All other scenes inherit from that

### Whatever changes we make to the parent scene, it will also affect the child scene
