# Pathfinding

### So far we moved enemies in the player direction or along a predefined path

### This is really simple enemy behavior

### One step to make the enemies smarter is to have them find the proper path to the player without getting stuck on walls

### First of all, we need a more interesting outside level

## Otherwise there is no point to pathfinding
