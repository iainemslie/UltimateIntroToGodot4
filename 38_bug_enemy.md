# Creating the bug

### A CharacterBody2D

### No sprite but an AnimatedSprite2D with an attack and walk animation

### There will be a NoticeArea2D and an AttackArea2D

### If the player enters the notice area the bug will move towards the player

### If the player enters the attack area the bug will attack with a cooldown and the attack animation

### Also add the shader if the bug gets hit (and kill the bug after a few shots)
