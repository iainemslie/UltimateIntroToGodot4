# Using a Camera

### All we have to do is add one more node to our player

### The `Camera2D` wants to be a child of the node that it will follow

### We enable position smoothing for a more natural feel

### Setting the zoom level we can zoom in or out

### We can also offset from the camera being centred

### We can set a limit which sets a perimeter which the camera cannot exceed
