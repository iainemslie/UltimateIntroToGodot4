# Animations

### Animations work by playing images in sequence

### Images can be in two formats:

1. Separate images: AnimatedSprite2D
2. Sprite sheets: Sprite2D (it has an animation tab)

### Animation Player - plays an animation

### By animation, we mean any kind of change in property (so move, rotation, animation frames, light energy etc.)

### You can also call methods

### And you get lots of control over these changes
